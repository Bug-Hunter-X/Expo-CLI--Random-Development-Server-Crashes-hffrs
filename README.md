# Expo CLI Random Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using Expo CLI. The development server crashes intermittently without providing error messages in the console. The app continues to function on the device or simulator, but the server needs manual restarting.

## Bug Description
The development server powered by Expo CLI would randomly crash during development. This would manifest as the server becoming unresponsive, with no error messages or stack traces in the console.  The application itself, however, would remain functional on the connected device or simulator. The only way to resolve this was to manually restart the Expo CLI development server.

## Reproduction Steps
Reproducing this bug proved difficult due to its random nature.  It didn't appear tied to any specific code or actions. Attempts to identify a pattern were unsuccessful.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)
The cause remains elusive.  However, potential contributing factors could include:
* Resource exhaustion (memory leaks in the Expo server or dependent processes). 
* Node.js version incompatibility or corruption. 
* Conflicting packages or dependencies.
* Issues with the underlying operating system or hardware.

## Solution
The provided solution file includes steps that helped resolve the issue. It mostly focuses on common troubleshooting that may help others.

## Note
The random and unpredictable nature of this bug made comprehensive debugging and isolation challenging. The solution isn't guaranteed to fix the issue in all cases but it's worth trying.
